# Test task app

[Link to deployed app](https://mysite-plcr.onrender.com/)

To achieve all requirements I used the next libraries and technologies:

- Tailwind for styles
- Ruby as a server-side language
- RSpec for automated MVC unit tests
- rubocop, fasterer, brakeman, rails_best_practices to analyze code
- pry for debugging
- mapkick-rb which uses mapbox to add map view with points
